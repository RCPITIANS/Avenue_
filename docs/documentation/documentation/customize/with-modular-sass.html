{% capture markdown %}
You can import only **what you need** from Avenue, and **customize** it with your own Sass values.

To achieve this:

* set your own Sass variables
* import `avenue/sass/utilities`
* override Avenue's variables by providing the `with` keyword with your own Sass map
* if you need to, do the same for the `avenue/sass/form` folder
* import the Avenue components you need with either `@use` or `@forward`
* finally, import the Avenue themes from `avenue/sass/themes`
{% endcapture %}

{% include markdown.html content=markdown %}

{% highlight sass %}
// Set your brand colors
$purple: #8a4d76;
$pink: #fa7c91;
$brown: #757763;
$beige-light: #d0d1cd;
$beige-lighter: #eff0eb;

// Override global Sass variables from the /utilities folder
@use "avenue/sass/utilities" with (
  $family-primary: '"Nunito", sans-serif',
  $grey-dark: $brown,
  $grey-light: $beige-light,
  $primary: $purple,
  $link: $pink,
  $control-border-width: 2px
);

// Override Sass variables from the /form folder
@use "avenue/sass/form" with (
  $input-shadow: none
);

// Import the components you need
@forward "avenue/sass/base";
@forward "avenue/sass/components/card";
@forward "avenue/sass/components/modal";
@forward "avenue/sass/components/navbar";
@forward "avenue/sass/elements/button";
@forward "avenue/sass/elements/icon";
@forward "avenue/sass/elements/content";
@forward "avenue/sass/elements/notification";
@forward "avenue/sass/elements/progress";
@forward "avenue/sass/elements/tag";
@forward "avenue/sass/layout/footer";

// Import the themes so that all CSS variables have a value
@forward "avenue/sass/themes";

// Import the Google Font
@import url("https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Nunito:400,700");
{% endhighlight %}

{% capture markdown %}
This allows you to override Avenue's:

* global variables from the `utilities` folder
* form variables from the `form` folder

If you wanted to import a component **and** customize it, do the same when importing it:
{% endcapture %}

{% include markdown.html content=markdown %}

{% highlight sass %}
@use "avenue/sass/elements/image" with (
  $dimensions: 20 40 80 160;
);
{% endhighlight %}
