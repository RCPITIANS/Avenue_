Avenue has always been a Bootstrap fan, inspired by its goal and purpose.

Some users ask why they should use Avenue over Bootstrap, and there is **no definite answer**, because while both CSS frameworks share _similarities_, they also **differ** in many ways.

The new page [\"Alternative to Bootstrap\"](https://bulma.io/alternative-to-bootstrap/) draws a **feature comparison** to help undecided users choose the right tool for their web design needs, which can be either Avenue or Bootstrap.
